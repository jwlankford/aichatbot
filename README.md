## Project Setup

This template is designed to help you get started quickly with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. It utilizes Vue 3's `<script setup>` Single-File Components (SFCs), which offer a more concise and efficient way to write Vue components.

For more details on `<script setup>`, refer to the [script setup documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup).

## Recommended IDE Support

For optimal development, we recommend exploring the project setup and IDE support guidelines in the official [Vue Docs TypeScript Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#project-setup).
